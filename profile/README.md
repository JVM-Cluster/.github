# About Github organization
We are GitHub organization uniting developers of JVM languages such as Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala with the goal of creating projects that are predominantly or at their core composed of JVM-based languages. The organization's mission is to bring people together, develop useful applications, both open-source and closed-source, and share knowledge.

# Projects
Currently, there is one full-stack project underway called oFitoo, with the backend primarily written in Java using Spring Boot and the frontend in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. The application aims to be competitive with apps such as Fitatu or MyFitnessPal, providing features for calorie counting, real-time biometric data tracking, and scanning barcode information for adding, removing, or modifying food items in the database along with their macronutrient and calorie details in various units of measurement.
