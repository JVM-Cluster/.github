# About Github organization
We are a GitHub organization that brings together programmers to create fully functional projects, whether purely business or non-profit. The organization's mission is to connect people, create useful applications, both open-source, and share knowledge.

# Projects
Currently, there is one full-stack project underway called oFitoo, with the backend primarily written in Java using Spring Boot and the frontend in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. The application aims to be competitive with apps such as Fitatu or MyFitnessPal, providing features for calorie counting, real-time biometric data tracking, and scanning barcode information for adding, removing, or modifying food items in the database along with their macronutrient and calorie details in various units of measurement.
